🌐 De-Drive: Decentralized Web3 Storage

A secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant alternative to centralized cloud storage. De-Drive allows users to upload, store, and share files directly on the blockchain using IPFS and Ethereum, ensuring that you—and only you—own your data.

🚀 The Vision

In a world where centralized tech giants control your personal data, De-Drive returns power to the user. By combining the immutability of the Ethereum blockchain with the distributed power of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), this project eliminates single points of failure and prevents unauthorized data mining.

🛡️ Why De-Drive?

True Ownership: Files are tied to your MetaMask wallet address, not a corporate account.

Privacy First: No centralized server ever sees your data.

Censorship Resistant: Once uploaded to the decentralized network, your files cannot be removed or blocked by a single entity.

Transparent Access: Manage who can view your files directly through Smart Contract logic.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js for a seamless, modern user interface.

Smart Contracts: Solidity for managing file access and ownership.

Development Framework: Hardhat for compiling, testing, and deploying contracts.

Storage: IPFS via Pinata for efficient, distributed file hosting.

Wallet Integration: MetaMask for secure authentication and transaction signing.

⚙️ How It Works

Authentication: Connect your MetaMask wallet to interact with the dApp.

Upload: When you upload a file, it is sent to IPFS, which returns a unique Content Identifier (CID).

Blockchain Indexing: The CID is stored on the Ethereum blockchain via a Solidity Smart Contract. This acts as a permanent ledger of your storage.

Access Control: Use the "Share" feature to grant specific wallet addresses permission to view your files. You can revoke this access at any time through a blockchain transaction.

📦 Features

 Secure File Upload: Direct integration with IPFS.

 Wallet-Based Login: No passwords; just your crypto keys.

 Access Management: Grant or revoke access to specific users.

 Immutable Ledger: Your file history is permanently recorded on-chain.
